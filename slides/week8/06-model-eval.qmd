## What did we do?

::: incremental
-   Used several models

-   Compared and contrasted efficacy

-   Concluded that we couldn't predict credit risk
:::

## Refresher on our data (with ordinal risk) {.smaller}

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
loans_class = pd.read_csv("data/loans_class.csv")

loans_class.head()
```

## Our preprocessing

```{python}
# Encode categorical variables
categorical_columns = loans_class.select_dtypes(include = ['object', 'category']).columns.tolist()

# Encode categorical variables
label_encoders = {col: LabelEncoder() for col in categorical_columns}
for col in categorical_columns:
    loans_class[col] = label_encoders[col].fit_transform(loans_class[col])
    
# Define features and target
X = loans_class.drop('risk', axis = 1)
y = loans_class['risk']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 42)

# Reduce dimensionality to prevent overfitting
pca = PCA(n_components = 2)
X_train_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_pca = pca.transform(X_test)
```

## Reminder: decision boundary

```{python}
def decisionplot(model, X, y, resolution=216):
    # Split the data into features (X) and the class variable (y)
    x_min, x_max = X.iloc[:, 0].min() - 1, X.iloc[:, 0].max() + 1
    y_min, y_max = X.iloc[:, 1].min() - 1, X.iloc[:, 1].max() + 1
    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(x_min, x_max, resolution),
                         np.linspace(y_min, y_max, resolution))

    # Predict outcomes for each point on the grid
    if isinstance(model, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis):
        # For LDA, we need to use the decision_function method
        Z = model.decision_function(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
    else:
        Z = model.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
    
    if isinstance(model, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis):
    # Reshape LDA decision function output appropriately
        Z = Z.reshape(-1, 1)
    else:
        Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)

    # Plot the actual data points
    plt.scatter(X.iloc[:, 0], X.iloc[:, 1], c=y, edgecolors='k', s=20)

    # Overlay the decision boundary
    plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha = 0.5)
    
    # Calculate the accuracy
    predictions = model.predict(X)
    acc = accuracy_score(y, predictions)
    
  
    # Set labels for axes
    plt.xlabel(X.columns[0])
    plt.ylabel(X.columns[1])

    plt.show()

## Model Evaluation {.smaller}

> **Model selection** is the task of selecting a model from among various candidates on the basis of performance criterion to choose the best one. In the context of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") and more generally [statistical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_analysis "Statistical analysis"), this may be the selection of a [statistical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model "Statistical model") from a set of candidate models, given data. Typically, [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%E2%80%99s_Razor#Science_and_the_scientific_method) is the best approach

::: fragment
#### Broadly we will focus on two categories
:::

::: fragment
**Evaluating performance**

-   The process of assessing the performance of a machine learning model using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to determine how effectively it makes predictions on new, unseen data.
:::

::: fragment
**Validation methods**

-   The technique of verifying a machine learning model's performance and reliability on a separate dataset (validation set) that was not used during the model's training, to ensure that it generalizes well to new data.
:::

## Evaluating performance

**Back to Confusion Matrices**

![](images/confusion.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="1067"}

## Accuracy {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Visual

![](images/accuracy.png){fig-align="left" width="612"}

**Error Rate** $= \frac{FP + FN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$

## Pros + Cons

::: fragment
**Definition**: The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.
:::

::: fragment
**Use Case**: Best for balanced datasets where each class is approximately equally represented.
:::

::: fragment
**Pros**:

::: incremental
-   Intuitive and easy to understand.

-   Useful when the costs of false positives and false negatives are similar.
:::
:::

::: fragment
**Cons**:

::: incremental
-   Can be misleading in imbalanced datasets (where one class significantly outnumbers the other).
-   Doesn't consider the type of errors (false positives vs. false negatives).
:::
:::
:::

## Precision {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Visual

![](images/precision.png){fig-align="left" width="612"}

**Error Rate** $= \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$

## Pros + Cons

::: fragment
**Definition**: The ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives. It's a measure of a classifier's exactness.
:::

::: fragment
**Use Case**: Important when the cost of false positives is high (e.g., in spam detection).
:::

::: fragment
**Pros**:

::: incremental
-   Focuses on the positive class's predictive power.

-   Useful in imbalanced datasets to evaluate the performance of the minority class.
:::
:::

::: fragment
**Cons**:

::: incremental
-   Does not consider false negatives (i.e., how many positive cases were missed).
:::
:::
:::

## Recall (Sensitivity) {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Visual

![](images/recall.png){fig-align="left" width="612"}

**Error Rate** $= \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$

## Pros + Cons

::: fragment
**Definition**: The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. It's a measure of a classifier's completeness.
:::

::: fragment
**Use Case**: Crucial when the cost of false negatives is high (e.g., in disease screening).
:::

::: fragment
**Pros**:

::: incremental
-   Ensures that most positive examples are correctly recognized.

-   Very useful in imbalanced datasets for evaluating how well the minority class is being predicted
:::
:::

::: fragment
**Cons**:

::: incremental
-   Does not consider false positives (i.e., can lead to many false alarms).
:::
:::
:::

## F1 Score {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Visual

![](images/f1-score.png){fig-align="left" width="612"}

**Error Rate** $= 2\times\frac{precision \times recall}{precision + recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + \frac{1}{2}(FP + FN)}$

## Pros + Cons

::: fragment
**Definition**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
:::

::: fragment
**Use Case**: When you need a balance between precision and recall.
:::

::: fragment
**Pros**:

::: incremental
-   Combines precision and recall into a single metric.

-   Useful in imbalanced datasets or when both types of errors are equally costly.
:::
:::

::: fragment
**Cons**:

::: incremental
-   Not as intuitive as accuracy.
-   Harmonic mean can be influenced heavily by lower values of either precision or recall.
:::
:::
:::

## **AUC-ROC** {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## +/- Positives

![](images/trueFalsePositives.png){fig-align="center" width="888"}

## E.g., Classifiers

![](images/classifiers.png){fig-align="center" width="888"}

## Trade-off

![](images/classifierMetrics.png){fig-align="center" width="915"}

## ROC

::: columns
::: {.column width="53%"}
![](images/roc.png){fig-align="center" width="838"}
:::

::: {.column width="47%"}
![](images/roc-1.png){fig-align="center" width="635"}
:::
:::

::: fragment
::: incremental
-   **Left side** = more "confident" thresholds: lower recall and fewer false positive errors

-   **Right side** = "less strict" scenarios when the threshold is low: both recall and False Positive rates are higher, ultimately reaching 100%
:::
:::

## ROC AUC

![](images/roc-auc.png){fig-align="center" width="888"}

::: incremental
-   Single metric to summarize the performance of models

-   Common calculation - [trapezoid rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule)
:::

## Pros + Cons

::: fragment
**Definition**: Measures the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes and is used as a summary of the ROC curve.
:::

::: fragment
**Use Case**: Effective for balanced and imbalanced datasets, especially for binary classification problems.
:::

::: fragment
**Pros**:

::: incremental
-   Performance measurement for the classification model at various thresholds settings.

-   AUC-ROC near 1 indicates a good ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
:::
:::

::: fragment
**Cons**:

::: incremental
-   Can be overly optimistic in imbalanced datasets.

-   Does not distinguish between types of errors.

## Applying model evaluation {.smaller}

Using the decision tree model

```{python}
#| echo: false
dtree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
dtree.fit(X_train_pca, y_train)
predictions = dtree.predict(X_test_pca)
```

## Applying model evaluation {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Accuracy

```{python}
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

## Precision

```{python}
precision = precision_score(y_test, predictions, average = 'weighted') # Use 'weighted' for multiclass
print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")
```

## Recall

```{python}
recall = recall_score(y_test, predictions, average = 'weighted') # Use 'weighted' for multiclass
print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")
```

## F1 Score

```{python}
f1 = f1_score(y_test, predictions, average = 'weighted') # Use 'weighted' for multiclass
print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.2f}")
```

## AUC-ROC

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
# Binarize the output for multiclass
y_test_binarized = label_binarize(y_test, classes = np.unique(y_train))
n_classes = y_test_binarized.shape[1]

# Get the probability predictions for each class
y_score = dtree.predict_proba(X_test_pca)

# Compute ROC curve and ROC area for each class
fpr = dict()
tpr = dict()
roc_auc = dict()
for i in range(n_classes):
    fpr[i], tpr[i], _ = roc_curve(y_test_binarized[:, i], y_score[:, i])
    roc_auc[i] = auc(fpr[i], tpr[i])

# Calculate macro-average ROC-AUC
roc_auc_macro = np.mean(list(roc_auc.values()))
print(f"Macro-average ROC-AUC: {roc_auc_macro:.2f}")

# Calculate micro-average ROC-AUC
fpr["micro"], tpr["micro"], _ = roc_curve(y_test_binarized.ravel(), y_score.ravel())
roc_auc_micro = auc(fpr["micro"], tpr["micro"])
print(f"Micro-average ROC-AUC: {roc_auc_micro:.2f}")
```
:::

::: incremental
-   **Binarization**: `label_binarize` is used to binarize the labels in a one-vs-all fashion which is necessary for multiclass ROC calculation.

-   **Macro-average**: computes the metric independently for each class and then takes the average (treating all classes equally).

-   **Micro-average**:aggregates the contributions of all classes to compute the average metric.
:::

## Conclusions

::: incremental
-   All values are relatively the same (\~50%)

-   Our risk column is unbalanced, so precision and recall are useful

-   The F1 Score is best to analyze our data (balance precision and recall)

-   ROC-AUC is effective in distinguishing classes
:::

## Cross validation {.smaller}

::: fragment
> A resampling method that evaluates machine learning models on a limited data sample. It involves partitioning a dataset into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset (training set), and validating the analysis on the other subset (validation set).
:::

::: fragment
**Use Case**: Widely used for assessing the effectiveness of predictive models, helping to safeguard against overfitting.
:::

::: fragment
**Pros**:

::: incremental
-   Provides a more accurate measure of a model's predictive performance compared to a simple train/test split.

-   Utilizes the data efficiently as every observation is used for both training and validation.
:::
:::

::: fragment
**Cons**:

::: incremental
-   Computationally intensive, especially for large datasets.

-   Results can vary depending on how the data is divided.
:::
:::

## Cross validation methods

::: incremental
-   Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation

-   k-Fold Cross-Validation
:::

## Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Visual

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/loocv.webp){fig-align="left" width="653"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Overall score**:

$\frac{score_1 + score_2 + score_3 + score_4 + score_5 + score_6}{6}$

::: fragment
For classification the score is:
:::

::: fragment
-   Accuracy
-   Precision, Recall, F1-Score
-   AUC-ROC
:::
:::
:::

## Pros + Cons

::: fragment
**Definition**: The number of folds equals the number of instances in the dataset. Each model is trained on all data points except one, which is used as the test set.
:::

::: fragment
**Use Case**: Useful for small datasets where maximizing the training data is important.
:::

::: fragment
**Pros**:

::: incremental
-   Utilizes the data to its maximum extent.

-   Reduces bias as each data point gets to be in the test set exactly once.
:::
:::

::: fragment
**Cons**:

::: incremental
-   Highly computationally expensive with large datasets.
-   High variance in the estimate of model performance as the evaluation can be highly dependent on the data points chosen as the test set.
:::
:::
:::

## k-Fold Cross-Validation (k-Fold) {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Visual

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/kfold.webp){fig-align="left" width="653"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Overall score**:

$\frac{score_1 + score_2 + score_3}{3}$

::: fragment
For classification the score is:
:::

::: fragment
-   Accuracy
-   Precision, Recall, F1-Score
-   AUC-ROC
:::
:::
:::

## Pros + Cons

::: fragment
**Definition**: The dataset is divided into k subsets, and the holdout method is repeated k times. Each time, one of the k subsets is used as the test set and the other k-1 subsets are put together to form a training set.
:::

::: fragment
**Use Case**: Ideal for both small and medium-sized datasets and when the balance between bias and variance is crucial.
:::

::: fragment
**Pros**:

::: incremental
-   Reduces the variance of a single trial of train/test split.

-   More reliable estimate of out-of-sample performance than LOOCV.
:::
:::

::: fragment
**Cons**:

::: incremental
-   Still computationally intensive, especially with large k.
-   Results can be dependent on the random division of the data into folds.
:::
:::

## Bias-Variance Trade-off

::: fragment
**Definition**: Refers to managing the trade-off between the bias of the model (error due to overly simplistic assumptions) and its variance (error due to sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set).
:::
:::

## The bootstrap method {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Visual

![](images/bootstrap.png){fig-align="center" width="1644"}

::: incremental
1.  **Sample creation**

2.  **Model training + evaluation**

3.  **Performance aggregation**
:::

## Pros + Cons

::: fragment
**Definition**: A statistical technique using repeated sampling with replacement from a dataset to train and evaluate model performance.
:::

::: fragment
**Use Case**: Ideal for small datasets or when assessing model performance variability. Commonly used for accuracy estimation and model validation.
:::

::: fragment
**Pros**:

::: incremental
-   **Variability estimation**: Offers insights into the model's performance variability.

-   **Flexible**: Non-parametric and adaptable to various data distributions.
:::
:::

::: fragment
**Cons**:

::: incremental
-   **Computationally demanding**: High computational cost due to repeated resampling and training.

-   **Overfitting bias**: Can be overly optimistic for overfitting models.

    -   **k-Fold CV** is best for [larger datasets]{.underline}

-   **Ordinal Logistic Regression** performed worst!
