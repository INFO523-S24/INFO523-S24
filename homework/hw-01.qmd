title: "Homework 1"
---

For any exercise where you're writing code, insert a code chunk and make sure to label the chunk. Use a short and informative label. For any exercise where you're creating a plot, make sure to label all axes, legends, etc. and give it an informative title. For any exercise where you're including a description and/or interpretation, use full sentences. Make a commit at least after finishing each exercise, or better yet, more frequently. Push your work regularly to GitHub, and make sure all checks pass.

## Part 1: Python Basics

### Task 1: Variables and Types

-   Define two variables: an integer named `age` with a value of 25 and a string named `course` with the value "Data Mining".
-   Print their values and types using the `type()` function.

### Task 2: Control Structures

-   Write a function `is_prime(num)` that takes an integer and returns `True` if the number is a prime number, `False` otherwise.
-   Include a loop and an appropriate control flow statement to check for primality.

### Task 3: Data Structures

-   Create a dictionary named `student_grades` with keys as student names and values as their grades (A, B, C, D, F).
-   Write a loop to print out each student's name and grade in the format: "Student \[Name\] has grade \[Grade\]".

### Task 4: List Comprehension & Functions

-   Using list comprehension, generate a list of tuples where each tuple is `(number, square of number)` for numbers between 1 and 10.
-   Write a function `calculate_stats(numbers)` that returns the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of numbers. Utilize functions from the `statistics` module.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 2: NumPy Introduction

### Task 1: NumPy Arrays

-   Create a NumPy array `A` of shape (10,10) with values ranging from 0 to 99.
-   Calculate the determinant of matrix `A` (use `numpy.linalg.det`). Print the result.

### Task 2: Array Operations

-   Given a 1D NumPy array of size 10, normalize it (i.e., scale the values to range between 0 and 1).

### Task 3: tract and print all the elements from the third column of a given 2D NumPy array.

-   Use a for loop to iterate through each element of this column and print their square roots.

### Task 4: Statistics with NumPy

-   Given a 2D NumPy array, calculate the mean, median, and variance along both rows and columns.
-   Identify the row with the maximum variance and print it out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 3: Pandas Introduction

### Task 1: Series and DataFrame Basics

-   Create a Pandas Series with the labels as the first 10 letters of the alphabet and the values as random integers from 1 to 100.
-   Convert this Series into a DataFrame with the column name 'Random_Numbers'.

### Task 2: Data Importing and Inspection

-   Load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. Assume the CSV has columns 'id', 'name', 'score'.
-   Print out the data types of the columns and the first 10 rows of the DataFrame.

### Task 3: Data Manipulation and Cleaning

-   Replace all instances of a missing 'score' with the median score.
-   Add a new column 'score_normalized' that contains the 'score' column normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

### Task 4: Data Aggregation and Grouping

-   Group the data by 'name' and calculate the average score for each group.
-   Create a new DataFrame that contains only the names and their corresponding average scores. Sort this DataFrame by the average scores in descending order.
